Deadlines:

  - Wed, Jun 1: dissertation proposal presentation
  Time: 1pm
  Location: Evans Conference Room (or Skype)
  - Wed, May 18: send out dissertation proposal document
  - Thu, May 11: rough draft of proposal in outline form


Rough Outline:

  - introduction
  outline rest of the paper (will later be flushed into full outline)
  should be 3-4 pages
  should not be about the contributions of this dissertation or what is novel
  more about **_why this thing is novel_**
  → what is the problem you are solving?
  multiple subsections: contributions & overview/outline
  include declaration of work!
  overview of all projects
  includes relevant contributions and how/why they are
  clear statements on what is done and what will be done
  brief discussion on how these are a step towards evaluating DAF
  timeline for the dissertation
  - background / related work
about design in general, across fields, maybe not, later… with daf stuff
  focus in visualization design, what’s been done?
  - chapter on design activity framework
  summary of the design activity framework -> NONE, do later
  overview with an example of its use
  may not be the full paper
  possibly just a summary
  - other chapters, parts of papers for now
  - conclusion
  short conclusion & discussion: be sure to address the impact of this work, future, 10 years out in this theme, what is the potential future work?
  - references


Will be doing some related work searching, mainly to see if references are up to date, as well as to dig into the most pertinent research on agile software engineering design. This may be better for the DAF background section in detail... not sure yet. Hmmm.

Expect it to be 25-30 pages

What is the theme? Related work should be around the theme. Need a true theme for the dissertation. Look at the high-level.

Take a look at Miriah’s intro for inspiration



What is the dissertation theme?

The theme is about visualization design... we need better ways to connect the design process to the decisions we make throughout that process. It would be useful to reflect on projects, find the artifacts that are useful, and utilize them to inspire others and reuse artifacts in related and similar projects. A framework that captures all of these complexities and nuances can help both novice and expert visualization designers be more effective and effective at designing visualizations for others.

What is the hope for my job talk?

I want to sell the fact that I know how to design. I can code. I can make visualizations. I know how to reflect on and use the design process to my advantage. I want to go on the job market with an effective portfolio based on these visualization designs. I want to wow people with what is possible, both on the design and coding side. I want to merge the two. That is my interest and hope for the future. I just hope that a design + programming job doesn't mean I get paid any less, since that would suck. We will see.


To-Do:

  - rearrange chapters: split apart DAF into own
  - hide parts of papers/chapters
  - revisit intro, clean up, shorten
  - background section
  - new barebones chapter intros
  - minimal conclusion/discussion chapter
