Rough Outline:

  - introduction
  summary of the design activity framework -> NONE, do later
  overview with an example of its use
  outline rest of the paper (will later be flushed into full outline)
  should be 3-4 pages
  should not be about the contributions of this dissertation or what is novel
  more about why this thing is novel
  → what is the problem you are solving?
  multiple subsections: contributions & overview/outline
  - background / related work
about design in general, across fields, maybe not, later… with daf stuff
  focus in visualization design, what’s been done?
  - chapter on design activity framework
  may not be the full paper
  possibly just a summary
  - declaration of work
  overview of all projects
  includes relevant contributions and how/why they are
  clear statements on what is done and what will be done
  brief discussion on how these are a step towards evaluating DAF
  timeline for the dissertation
  - conclusion
  short conclusion & discussion: be sure to address the impact of this work, future, 10 years out in this theme, what is the potential future work?
  - references/bibliography
  where to put list of my own publications?


  Will be doing some related work searching, mainly to see if references are up to date, as well as to dig into the most pertinent research on agile software engineering design.
Expect it to be 25-30 pages
What is the theme? Related work should be around the theme. Need a true theme for the dissertation. Look at the high-level.
Take a look at Miriah’s intro for inspiration



What is the dissertation theme?

  

What is the hope for my job talk?




To-Do:

  - questions above...
  - rearrange chapters: split apart DAF into own
  - hide parts of papers/chapters
  - revisit intro, clean up, shorten
  - background section
  - new barebones chapter intros
  - minimal conclusion/discussion chapter
