# Thesis Office Concerns

From Kelly:
On p. 12, you first refer to Figure 2.4 in the text so place the figure at the bottom of the page below the text.
On pp. 14, 24, 25, 26, 33, 47, 60, 76, 80, 123, do the same thing.
On p. 68, you first refer to Figure 5.5 at the bottom of the page so place the figure on the next page rather than p. 70.
On p. 87, you first refer to Figure 6.1 at the bottom of the page so place the figure on page p. 89 rather than p. 90.

Check Margins: 1.25 inches on the left and right and 1 inch only on the bottom, >1 in at top IF starts with heading only
**BE CAREFUL with Adobe Reader - compression CHANGED the margins! perhaps don't compress for printing?**

See "ThesisOffice" mentions for additional, material-specific concerns.
