# Thesis Office Concerns

Oxford Dictionary vs standard of "cybersecurity" vs "cyber security"? --> IEEE treats cyber as a prefix but not a common one. safer to go with "cybersecurity"

Figure text must be at least 2mm. check fig 7.4, fig 7.7

Check Margins: 1.25 inches on the left and right and 1 inch only on the bottom, >1 in at top IF starts with heading only

lists of figs/tables? only if between 5 & 25 is it required?

T.O. IEEE uses Fig. but will they correct to Figure?

fix use of Figure #. to just Fig. #. in the latex! this is IEEE style correctly. it is in the text but not the captions yet.

Get permission from authors, email is fine?

See "ThesisOffice" mentions for additional, material-specific concerns.
