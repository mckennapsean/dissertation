# Thesis Office Concerns

Citing authors with et al. needs better spacing, OR automatic names.

Remove all figures & refs from Chapter 2

For ref at page bottom, place fig on following page (1 pg too late!):
Fig 5.5 | fig:sketches (fixed by moving figure right before paragraph)
Fig 6.1 | fig:u-worksheet (not fully fixed, table and figure misordered now)

Pages with figures should have at least 6 consecutive lines of text, or none.

Title page: divide up title further (inverse pyramid), possibly OK
Title page: even spacing between all sections (e.g. 6 lines), possibly OK
Table of Contents: sentence case for Chapters & Appendices, possibly OK

Check Margins: 1.25 inches on the left and right and 1 inch only on the bottom, >1 in at top IF starts with heading only
**BE CAREFUL with Adobe Reader - compression CHANGED the margins! perhaps don't compress for printing?**
