# Thesis Office Concerns

Compile uu-dissertation with chapter 2 with no figures & only 'p' placement.

Footnotes & figures, check to see which should be at bottom (5.7, 7.5).

Place figures at top of page when appropriate (3.6, 5.3, 7.4).

Pages with figures should have at least 6 consecutive lines of text, or none.

Title page: divide up title further (inverse pyramid), possibly OK
Title page: even spacing between all sections (e.g. 6 lines), possibly OK
Table of Contents: sentence case for Chapters & Appendices, possibly OK

Check Margins: 1.25 inches on the left and right and 1 inch only on the bottom, >1 in at top IF starts with heading only
**BE CAREFUL with LaTeX - default page format needs to be set to letter!**
