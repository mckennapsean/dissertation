# Thesis Office Concerns

Compile uu-dissertation with chapter 2 with no figures.

Pages with figures should have at least 6 consecutive lines of text, or none.

Title page: divide up title further (inverse pyramid), possibly OK
Title page: even spacing between all sections (e.g. 6 lines), possibly OK
Table of Contents: sentence case for Chapters & Appendices, possibly OK

Check Margins: 1.25 inches on the left and right and 1 inch only on the bottom, >1 in at top IF starts with heading only
**BE CAREFUL with Adobe Reader - compression CHANGED the margins! perhaps don't compress for printing?**
