# Thesis Office Concerns

Compile uu-dissertation with chapter 2 with no figures & only 'p' placement.

Watch out for "et al.\" placed at end of line, creates new line!

Some figures are a page late due to paragraph endings: Figs 3.4, 7.2, 7.4.

Title page: divide up title further (inverse pyramid), possibly OK
Title page: even spacing between all sections (e.g. 6 lines), possibly OK
Table of Contents: sentence case for Chapters & Appendices, possibly OK

Check Margins: 1.25 inches on the left and right and 1 inch only on the bottom, >1 in at top IF starts with heading only
**BE CAREFUL with LaTeX - default page format needs to be set to letter!**
