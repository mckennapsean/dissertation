# Thesis Office Concerns

Compile uu-dissertation with chapter 2 with no figures & only 'p' placement.

Title lengths should be MAX 4.5" and inverted pyramid. Title page!

The date on title page should match end of graduating semester, so change to Dec 2017?

Title page: divide up title further (inverse pyramid), possibly OK
Title page: even spacing between all sections (e.g. 6 lines), possibly OK
Table of Contents: sentence case for Chapters & Appendices, possibly OK
