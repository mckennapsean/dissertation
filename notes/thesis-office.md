# Thesis Office Concerns

Oxford Dictionary vs standard of "cybersecurity" vs "cyber security"? --> IEEE treats cyber as a prefix but not a common one. safer to go with "cybersecurity"

Figure text must be at least 2mm. check fig 7.4, fig 7.7

Get permission from authors, email is fine?

From Kelly:
On p. 12, you first refer to Figure 2.4 in the text so place the figure at the bottom of the page below the text.
On pp. 14, 24, 25, 26, 33, 47, 60, 76, 80, 123, do the same thing.
On p. 68, you first refer to Figure 5.5 at the bottom of the page so place the figure on the next page rather than p. 70.
On p. 87, you first refer to Figure 6.1 at the bottom of the page so place the figure on page p. 89 rather than p. 90.

Should Figures in the captions and text say Figure or Fig.? IEEE is shortened, but Thesis Office may override this. The LaTeX template overrides currently: "\fnum@figure"

Check Margins: 1.25 inches on the left and right and 1 inch only on the bottom, >1 in at top IF starts with heading only
**BE CAREFUL with Adobe Reader - compression CHANGED the margins! perhaps don't compress for printing?**

See "ThesisOffice" mentions for additional, material-specific concerns.
