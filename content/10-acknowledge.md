This dissertation would not have been possible without the guidance, support,
and critique of my supervisory committee: Miriah, Alexander, Tamara, James, and
Nathalie. Miriah has been a huge guiding light throughout my PhD, keeping my
focus on the big picture, teaching me how to become a visualization designer,
researcher, and practitioner. It has been an honor to work with her over these
past five years, and it has been a pleasure to learn and grow under her
mentorship. Alexander has provided similar support ever since he joined the
University of Utah, and it has been a pleasure to work with him as the new
Visualization Design Lab was established and as he taught students for the data
visualization course. Tamara played a big role in guiding me through the large
topic of research ethics and human research, and her course on human-centered
security helped motivate the data sketches design method that I conducted. James
taught me, through practice, observation, and discussion, a lot about design and
making better systems for humans to use, and I enjoyed our project together as
we redesigned a visualization tool and formulated the ground work for the design
activity framework. Lastly, but certainly not least, Nathalie and I worked
together for years, from visualizing set-typed data to establishing requirements
for a storytelling authoring tool, and her inspiration, enthusiasm, and
brilliance helped us describe and evaluate concepts for visual narrative flow.

I would like to personally thank the following colleagues of the University of
Utah Visualization Design Lab for all their help and feedback on this
dissertation: Ethan Kerzner, P. Samuel Quinan, Alex Bigelow, Nina McCurdy,
Carolina Nobre, Jimmy Moore, T Cameron Waller, and Kristen Zygmunt. I also thank
Jonzy and Dan Bowden for their cooperation and feedback on the visualization
data sketches method. The staff members at MIT Lincoln Laboratory played a
significant role in the success of the BubbleNet project from design to
deployment, which was made possible through the guidance of Diane Staheli. For
the redesign project, Dominika Mazur, Matthew Parkin, and James Agutter all
contributed significantly to this project as well. On the s-CorrPlot tool, this
project would not have been possible without the initial tool written by Samuel
Gerber, as well as the addtional feedback from Kristi Potter, Wei-Chao Huang,
Tom Fletcher, and Kristen Zygmunt. In the narrative flow project, this
evaluation would not have been possible without the guiding support of Bongshin
Lee and Jeremy Boy, as well as many other feedback provided from researchers and
interns at Microsoft Research. Lastly, I would like to thank both Michael
Sedlmair and Mike Kirby for their feedback and advice when writing the initial
design activity framework paper.


The work presented in this dissertation would not have been possible without
funding support. A majority of this work is sponsored by the Air Force Research
Laboratory and the DARPA XDATA program. Additionally, I was provided the Wayne
Brown Fellowship by the College of Engineering which aided in my first years of
research and study. This work is also sponsored in part by the Office of Naval
Research award N00014-12-1-0601 and the U.S. Army Research Office under a prime
contract issued to Intelligent Automation, Inc. The Lincoln Laboratory portion
of this work was sponsored by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research &
Engineering under Air Force Contract FA8721-05-C-0002. Opinions,
