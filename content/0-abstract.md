This dissertation is about a user-centered framework for visualization design: the design activity framework.
We present this framework as a validated methodology for visualization designers pursuing problem-driven work, such as design studies.
The key novel aspects of this framework includes its flexibility for iteration, actionability to guide designers, and connections to existing models across fields.
We have utilized this framework to formulate, guide, and reflect on the design process of several case studies in the fields of cyber security, biology, and data storytelling.
For each of these projects, we have employed a variety of qualitative design methods in order to validate the utility of these methods in real-world projects and reflect on using them in future projects.
Furthermore, we illustrate the importance of design artifacts or outcomes and how they can play a useful and continued role in a project.
We conclude by reflecting on what we have learned about the visualization design process from our case studies to inform future problem-driven visualization research, design, and development.
