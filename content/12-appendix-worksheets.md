# Design Worksheet Materials {#app:worksheets}

We provide additional worksheets and materials for the design activity
framework. These resources were utilized in conjunction with the incorporation
of these materials in a visualization graduate course, as discussed in
[@sec:worksheets]. First, we include two introductory worksheets used to teach
the framework. In [@fig:worksheet-intro1], we introduce the high-level
components of the design activity framework with some examples. Next we provide
sketching tips and resources for the design worksheets, as seen in
[@fig:worksheet-intro2]. The four design activity worksheets are shown in
[@sec:worksheets]. Lastly, we provide a front worksheet template in
[@fig:worksheet-template] to guide students through the different components of
the design activity framework worksheets.
