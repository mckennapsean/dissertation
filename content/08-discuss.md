## Discussion and Future Work

The design activity framework lays ground work for further research into the
space connecting creative design with engineering design.
...


The design activity framework is by no means complete. Future projects may
reveal subtle aspects and new meanings to what visualization artifacts can mean
for a project.
...
The design activity can and should evolve over time to adapt to more kinds of
visualization design projects to keep its use valid with how systems are
designed for users.


More work still needs to be done to continue the validation of this framework.
While this dissertation presents several case studies to support the design
activity framework, there are still other models out there to be considered and
validated as well. Different people may work better with other models or by
adapting existing ones, from the visualization field or otherwise.
...


Lastly, the distinction between technique-driven work and problem-driven work
provides another interesting challenge for design models. This work focused
heavily on problem-driven work, with a few case studies where techniques did
come out of them.
...
While we believe the design activity framework can have connections with
technique-driven work, more study and validation is required to investigate this
notion.



## Design Activity Framework

Throughout our redesign project, we worked closely as a design team composed of
designers, a psychologist, and visualization experts. Our different perspectives
and experience led to a richer and more informed design process. When working
together, we found that having common terms and definitions for design was
critical in promoting effective and efficient communication among all members
--- as such, we spent significant time and effort learning from each other to
better understand, and speak in, each other's domain languages [@Kirby2013].
This effort allowed us to synthesize the ideas and perspectives on the design
process from several different fields into the design activity framework.


As a process model, the main goal of the design activity framework is to guide
visualization designers through a design process. We believe that the framework
will be useful to those with a broad range of expertise. The actionability of
the framework stems from the inclusion of more than just activities and methods,
as is done in other models such as the nine-stage framework [@Sedlmair2012b].
Specifically, the design activity framework also includes motivations, outcomes,
and explicit ties to the nested model in order to help guide a designer through
the visualization design process. The motivation enables a designer to determine
which activity is currently being performed, which then allows the designer to
identify potential methods, clarify outcomes, and place decisions within the
nested model. Although the design activity framework targets problem-driven
visualization work, we could not identify a concrete reason why it could not be
useful for technique-driven work as well; this extension presents interesting,
future work.


The framework supports a large amount of flexibility by enabling and emphasizing
a workflow that includes both the nesting of activities and activities occurring
in parallel. As shown in [@fig:timeline], the design activity framework can
represent a process where many activities are pieced together in different ways
according to the motivation of the project at any given time. We feel that this
flexibility enables the framework to more completely capture the true nature of
multilinear, real-world visualization design in ways that previous visualization
process models and their representations do not.


In addressing the design process more generally, the design community does not
have a consensus on any particular process model [@DaGandra2012], nor do they
even agree that any such model could capture the "black box" of design
[@Fallman2003a]. Furthermore, considering design as a wicked problem
[@Buchanan1992; @Farrell2013; @Gaver2012; @Wolf2006], it can be challenging to
know where to go next, when to stop, and what makes an effective design
[@Buchanan1992]. These challenges exist for many design process models,
including the design activity framework, pointing to opportunities for further
investigation.


The design activity framework has several limitations, the first of which is
that the framework's connections to the nested model may not always be as clean
as those shown in [@fig:nm-comparison]. We were able to identify several corner
cases where outcomes of a process could begin to overlap onto an additional
level of the nested model. Furthermore, the framework does not include a
planning activity, which is present in other process models [@Sedlmair2012b;
DIS2010]. Although important for design, we feel that planning is unique and
complementary to the design activity framework. For example, the _precondition
stages_ of the nine-stage framework [@Sedlmair2012b] could be combined with the
design activity framework to serve as the planning activity. Lastly, we believe
that there is still much to understand and articulate about the design process
for visualization. With respect to the design activity framework, further
research could extend the framework such as more finely defining or breaking
apart specific activities, adding new activities, or making the connection to a
different design decision model.


We present a novel visualization design process model, the design activity
framework, which begins to address the messy, iterative, and multilinear process
of real-world visualization design. The overall goal of this work is to help
guide visualization designers through the design process, encourage
visualization designers to consider new design methods for generation or
evaluation, and assist the compact communication of a design process, as in
[@fig:timeline]. We consider all design models to be a work-in-progress, and the
design activity framework is by no means excluded. Further validating this
framework against additional visualization design projects remains an
interesting avenue for future work.


There are a number of additional open questions for future work. For example, we
established this framework from a problem-driven methodology, and it would be
useful to rigorously, but cautiously, validate the use of the framework for a
technique-driven approach. Furthermore, in the list of exemplar methods we
include novel methods for visualization design, but the utility and
effectiveness of these methods for designing a visualization system have yet to
be tested and verified. There are also a series of challenges yet to be
addressed by most visualization process models: Where should I go next in the
process? What method is the best for my situation? When do I know my design is
effective enough? We believe these future directions provide rich opportunities
to further explore the role of design for visualization.



## User-Centered Design Methods

In our case studies, we demonstrated how user-centered design methods can be
both efficient and effective for visualization design. Specifically, we
highlighted the projects' visualization artifacts, guiding motivations, and
final results as a result of each method: qualitative coding, personas, and data
sketches.


User-centered design methods can help a designer establish user needs, uncover
design opportunities, and evaluate ideas. The three design methods discussed in
this paper can incorporate any varied number of users. We encourage future
visualization design projects to broaden the methodologies, methods, and
techniques at their disposal in order to more completely explore the design
space. Ultimately, embracing user-centered design methods and the importance of
the design process will help us as a community be more efficient at building
effective visualization tools across domains, users, data, and tasks.
