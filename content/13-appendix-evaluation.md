# Worksheet Evaluation Materials {#app:evaluation}

In [@sec:worksheets], we discussed the methodology behind our process for
evaluating the design activity framework worksheets. We utilized these
worksheets for students undergoing a cumulative project for the course, and we
surveyed students at the end of the course on their experiences and opinion of
the materials. We provide the prompts and questions we used in the two online
questionnaires, one of which was sent to the entire class and another which was
sent only to 13 volunteers that utilized the worksheets as part of their
project. For the survey questions, responses were in one of the following
formats: five-point Likert scale (denoted with L), numbered scale (1-5, denoted
N), free-form text response (denoted T), or a multiple select choice of design
activities (denoted UIMD). Lastly, I conducted semistructured interviews with 11
of the student volunteers, and the interview guide with base questions is
included. These materials serve the purpose of adding reproducibility to the
evaluation methodology and, further, to enable external validation of this work.

1. It was possible to fully complete each worksheet using the materials given to me during the course. (L)
1. The design worksheets were used to record artifacts or decisions I made, after they were already made. (L)
1. I was able to better structure my design process with the help of the design worksheets. (L)
1. There was not enough structure or guidance provided on the worksheets in order to complete them. (L)
1. I was able to figure out where to go next in the design process with the help of the design worksheets. (L)
1. There was too much information or text included on the blank design worksheets. (L)
1. I was able to capture design decisions easily and succinctly using the design worksheets. (L)
1. The system developed for my final project would have been just as effective if we had not used the design worksheets. (L)
1. What are some suggested changes or improvements for the worksheets? (T)
1. Please include any additional comments on the design worksheets. (T)





## Interview Guide

Thanks for agreeing to meet and discuss your experiences this semester. We are looking for sincere, honest feedback of the design worksheets we utilized. This includes elements on the worksheets, when they were introduced & taught, when we utilized them, how we utilized them, and anything else you think would have helped you learn more and practice being a better visualization designer.

Are you OK with recording this interview? It is for me to review later without scribbling notes.

1. The worksheets were created for teaching the design process. Can you describe the steps of the design process, briefly in your own words?
1. What were the most useful aspects of the worksheets for your project? Least useful?
1. How did you fill out the worksheets? Was it done as a group or individually? When was it most comfortable for you to fill these out?
1. Was it helpful to have an evaluation step? Think of sketches, ideas. Why or why not?
1. Were the design worksheets helpful for documenting your design process? Are the worksheets a useful tool for helping you write a process book? e.g. think of what you did during the Ideate and Make parts of your design process.
1. Did the worksheets help guide you through the design process? For example, where to go next, revisiting sheets, etc. Why or why not?
1. Are you encouraged to try out new design methods after using the sheets? Did you?
1. Are there any additional worksheets that could have been helpful for your project? Did you feel any steps were missing from the worksheets?
1. Did the worksheets limit your choices or fail to capture the complexity of how you design a visualization? Please explain.
1. Would you say that the design worksheets helped build your confidence in design? In what ways could it have helped you learn more & built up your confidence more effectively?
1. Do you have any additional comments, questions, or feedback?

Thank you again for participating in this interview. This work is part of my Ph.D. dissertation, to create teaching materials for visualization design. I greatly appreciate advising your final group and seeing how these worksheets helped shape your final project. It was a wonderful experience getting to see your group interact together and create _____. I look forward to seeing your work in the future, and feel free to reach out to me if you have any lingering questions about visualization design, these worksheets, or anything else.

We hope to report on our findings using these worksheets in a classroom setting as a short paper at a visualization conference. Are you comfortable with quotes being taken anonymously from this interview to be included in that publication? It is totally fine to say no.

Before we conclude, do you have any other questions for me? Thanks again for your time!
