# Conclusion {#sec:conclusion}

The main contribution of this dissertation is the design activity framework for
visualization design [@McKenna2014]. By building off of existing visualization
design process and decisions models, the design activity framework seeks to
support both a creative and engineering visualization design process, one with
both iterative and linear aspects at its core. By prescribing four different
design activities, _understand_, _ideate_, _make_, and _deploy_, the framework
allows visualization designers to check their progress and current activity by
definitions of motivations and expected results or visualization artifacts, such
as requirements, ideas, prototypes, and visualization systems. These activities
map to levels of the nested model to help in choosing appropriate validation
approaches, and the framework identifies a series of potentially useful and
impactful methods for generating and evaluating visualization artifacts. Lastly,
the framework's activities can be represented in a concise timeline format, to
support design team communication and retrospection.


The role of the design activity framework is illustrated through two case
studies for cyber security. The first case study explores a redesign project of
a company's visualization tool [@McKenna2014], and the design activity framework
was created as a result of this project when reflecting on the various
activities we performed as a design team, utilizing user-centered design methods
like qualitative coding of research papers on user studies [@McKenna2015]. The
next case study examines the creation of a visualization dashboard called
BubbleNet [@mckenna2016]. As a result of this design study, we created a
dashboard tailored for visualizing certain geographic and temporal patterns in
security-based alert datasets, and it was evaluated through a series of methods
including a usabiilty study. Like the previous case study, user-centered design
methods again helped progress the project through personas to winnow and target
specific users and data sketches to compare and contrast possible visual
encodings with a cyber security analyst [@McKenna2015]. The design activity
framework framed and guided this second case study from the ground up, in
visualization design activities spanning across multiple discourse channels.


A potential benefit of the design activity framework is its actionability for
teaching novices how to conduct a visualization design process. We investigated
this aspect in a graduate visualization course with student cumulative projects
[@mckenna2017a]. To more effectively teach the visualization design process, we
created teaching materials for the course: a lecture on visualization design, an
introduction to the design activity framework, resources on sketching, and four
design activity worksheets. Each of these design worksheets was tailored to the
four activities for visualization design, and they included step-by-step
instructions, guidance, tips, and hints to guide students through their first
visualization project. We worked with 13 students throughout the course, to
mentor their projects and teams, and evaluated the worksheets and this process
using group observations, online surveys, and interviews. Overall, the design
worksheets were a good first attempt, and students highlighted a number of
improvements for the future.


By reflecting on other types of research we have conducted, we explored how
visualization design and the design activity framework relate to other kinds of
research, both technique-driven [@mckenna2015s] and evaluative work
[@mckenna2017]. Discussions for each of these projects is considered with regard
to how visualization design process models and the pedagogy of these models can
be improved over time. As the field of data visualization matures, it is of
critical importance to adapt and modify our design models in order to better
prescribe, describe, encompass, analyze, and communicate the visualization
design process.
