# Conclusion {#sec:conclusion}

The main contribution of this dissertation is a design activity framework for
visualization design [@McKenna2014]. By building on existing visualization
design process and decisions models, the design activity framework seeks to
support both a creative and engineering visualization design process, one with
both iterative and linear aspects at its core. By prescribing four design
activities, _understand_, _ideate_, _make_, and _deploy_, the framework allows
visualization designers to check their progress and current activity with clear
definitions, motivations, and expected results or visualization artifacts, such
as requirements, ideas, prototypes, and visualization systems. These activities
map to levels of the nested model to help designers choose appropriate
validation approaches, and the framework identifies a series of potentially
useful and impactful methods for generating and evaluating visualization
artifacts. Lastly, the framework's activities can be represented in a concise
timeline format, to support design team communication and retrospection.


The role of the design activity framework is illustrated through two case
studies for cybersecurity. The first case study explored a redesign project of a
company's visualization tool [@McKenna2014]. The design activity framework was
established based on our reflections of the various activities we performed as a
design team, utilizing user-centered design methods such as qualitative coding
of research papers on user studies [@McKenna2015]. The next case study examined
the creation of a visualization dashboard called BubbleNet [@mckenna2016]. As a
result of this design study, we created a dashboard tailored for visualizing
geographic and temporal patterns in security-based alert datasets, which we
evaluated through a series of methods including a usability study. Like the
previous case study, user-centered design methods advanced the project through
personas to winnow and target specific users and data sketches to compare and
contrast possible visual encodings with a cybersecurity analyst [@McKenna2015].
The framework guided the visualization design activities of this second case
study from the ground up, spanning multiple discourse channels.


In order to externally evaluate the framework and increase its actionability, we
investigated teaching novices how to conduct a visualization design process. To
this end, we created design worksheets for students to use in a cumulative
project for a graduate visualization course [@mckenna2017a]. To more effectively
teach the visualization design process, we created teaching materials for the
course: a lecture on visualization design, an introduction to the design
activity framework, resources on sketching, and four design activity worksheets.
We tailored each worksheet to the four activities for visualization design,
including step-by-step instructions, guidance, tips, and hints to guide students
through their first visualization project. We worked with 13 students throughout
the course, helping them with their projects and teamwork, and we externally
evaluated the worksheets using group observations, online surveys, and
interviews. Overall, the design worksheets were a successful first attempt, and
students highlighted a number of improvements for the future.


By reflecting on other types of research projects we have conducted, we explored
how visualization design and the design activity framework relate to other kinds
of research, both technique-driven [@mckenna2015s] and evaluative work
[@mckenna2017]. In particular, we identified new types of pitfalls for design
studies and observed how the steps of the visualization design process mapped to
both technique-driven prototypes and experimental design research. Over time, it
is important to build upon these design models and continue to validate their
usefulness and effectiveness for all kinds of visualization designers, from
students in the classroom to expert practitioners in industry. By working with
more visualization designers over time, new models can expand upon this work to
capture new types of visualization research and design projects. As the field of
data visualization matures, it is crucial we modify and adapt our design models
in order to better prescribe, describe, encompass, analyze, and communicate the
visualization design process.
