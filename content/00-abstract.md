This dissertation focuses on a new visualization design process model, geared
towards guiding novice visualization designers to tackle problem-driven work and
build more effective and useful visualization systems and tools. The key novel
aspects of this framework include its flexibility for iteration, actionablity
to guide novice designers with concrete steps and simplified definitions,
and connections to other visualization models commonly used in the field.
In summary, the design activity framework breaks down the design process into a
series of four design activities: _understand_, _ideate_, _make_, and _deploy_.
For each activity, there is a simple but descriptive motivation, list of design
methods, and specific visualization artifacts. Specifically, two different case
studies in the field of cyber security illustrate each of these concepts in
detail, provided as examples for novice visualization designers to understand
this complex, iterative process. Furthermore, design worksheets for each
activity are presented, with a series of concrete, tangible steps for a novice
to follow a visualization design process more effectively. These design
worksheets underwent an initial qualitative evaluation in a visualization course
utilizing 11 in-depth interviews and 32 student survey responses. Furthermore,
various types of research beyond problem-driven design studies exist, such as
technique driven design and formative, exploratory work, and we reflect on the
role of the design activity framework for two research projects in the fields of
biology and data visualization storytelling. Lastly, we conclude with a
discussion of the design activity framework and present future work in this
space for the community to explore, learn, and reflect on how this design
process can be more effectively taught to novice visualization designers and
improve their ability to perform problem-driven visualization research, design,
and development.
