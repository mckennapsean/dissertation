# Table of Design Methods {#sec:app-methods}

To aid in the search for new design methods, we present an extended table of
design methods in [@tbl:100methods]. This table is an extension of
[@tbl:methods] from [@sec:framework]. For [@tbl:100methods], we mapped 100
design methods into the design activity framework [@McKenna2014]. Each design
method is marked for which design activities it may be utilized, e.g.,
_understand_ (**_u_**), _ideate_ (**_i_**), _make_ (**_m_**), or _deploy_
(**_d_**). Within an activity, we coded these methods based on its main purpose,
to be generative (**_g_**) or evaluative (**_e_**). We noted when generating
this table that methods may play differing roles in one activity to the next.
Additionally, we tagged the methods we have seen commonly reported within the
visualization community (**_v_**). Lastly, each method includes a succinct
definition and source for visualization designers to research and learn more
about a desired design method.
