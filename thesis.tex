%%% -*-LaTeX-*-
%%% ====================================================================
%%% This is a sample top-level LaTeX-2e file for typesetting a thesis
%%% or dissertation at the University of Utah.  Most students find it
%%% convenient to start with a COPY of this file as a template, and
%%% then alter that copy to match their needs.
%%%
%%% There is an associated Unix Makefile that can be similarly
%%% customized, and then the only command ever needed to typeset the
%%% complete thesis is the single word "make".  Of course, during
%%% writing and typesetting, not all of the steps are needed, so
%%% often, one can just name a convenience target such as "make
%%% dvi-pass" or "make pdf-pass" to do just a single pass of LaTeX and
%%% BibTeX.
%%%
%%% There should be no, or very few, macro definitions in this file;
%%% any needed belong in a private style file, called mythesis.sty,
%%% and input below after all other packages.  The bulk of this file
%%% should just be command invocations, and any arguments that they
%%% need.
%%%
%%% We exploit the fact that TeX ignores spaces after command names to
%%% line up arguments for better readability.
%%%
%%% Each chapter should be a separate complete file, so that you can
%%% insert a command like \includeonly{chap_intro} before the first
%%% \include{chap_xxx} command to avoid typesetting all but the
%%% chapter that you are currently working on, to save time.
%%%
%%% Remember that occupants of job positions change jobs from time to
%%% time: YOU are responsible for ensuring correct names of all humans
%%% mentioned in this file!

%%% Undefine two macros from uuthesis2e.cls that conflict with

%%% NB: The amsthm package refines the LaTeX theorem environment,
%%% and the uuthesis-color-headings wraps that definition, so the
%%% amsthm package must be read first!

%%% ====================================================================
%%% The remaining packages are required by this particular thesis,
%%% but other theses will almost certainly need different packages:
%%%
%%% WARNING: MANY \LaTeX{} packages change dimensions, glue, and/or
%%% formatting styles, and such changes are likely to conflict with
%%% University of Utah Thesis Office requirements.  Therefore, minimize
%%% the number of packages that you include!
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{booktabs} % better latex tables
\usepackage{longtable} % tables beyond 1 page
% \usepackage{url} % must be careful when changing formatting for text/hypertext links!
\usepackage{afterpage} % execute command after page break
% \usepackage{varioref} % smart referencing (e.g. on this page, on page XX)
% \usepackage{subfigure} % create nested figure structures
\usepackage{multirow} % formatting cells going beyond one row

%%% ====================================================================
%%% Support for a subject index:
%% \usepackage{uuthesis-index}

%%% ====================================================================
%%% The various uuthesis-*.sty packages must come AFTER all other
%%% system-provided packages, so that they can correctly override
%%% settings from those packages.

%%% Include latest updates for 2016 (WARNING: the name is subject to
%%% change: see http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/uuthesis/ for the most
%%% current version.)
\usepackage{styles/uuthesis-2016-h}  % MANDATORY package

%%% This is an OPTIONAL package that sets chapter and sectional headings
%%% in color:
%%% Use one or the other of these:
\usepackage{color}
\usepackage{styles/uuthesis-color-headings}
%%%
%%% NB: Be careful with use of colors in typesetting, and in figures,
%%% because about 6 percent of the human male population is red/green
%%% color blind: they see those colors as shades of brown.  Red and
%%% blue, or blue and green, are better choices for choosing
%%% distinguishable colors.  Also, avoid light colors, especially
%%% yellow, because they are hard to see against white paper and
%%% screen backgrounds, and when printed on black-and-white printers,
%%% where they are rendered in gray, they may be too faint to read.

%%% ====================================================================
%%% Support for a subject index:
%: \usepackage{uuthesis-index}

%%% ====================================================================
%%% This single user-specific file is where all personal customizations
%%% and macro definitions should be placed, and it should come LAST,
%%% after ALL OTHER packages, in case it needs to override some of their
%%% definitions.

\dedication             {To ...}

%%% Most students need just a short degree name, like this:
% \degree                 {Doctor of Philosophy}
%%% However, multiline degrees are possible, and are done like this:
\degree                 {Doctor of Philosophy \\
                        in \\

\chairtitle             {Professor}


%%% NB: It is rare, but possible, for there to be two chairs, For
%%% example, one student had
%%%
%%% \committeechair{\mbox{\small Andrej Cherkaev and Andrejs Treibergs}}
%%%
%%% The \mbox{} ensures that line breaks cannot happen, and the \small
%%% is necessary to make the names fit on the Dissertation Approval form
