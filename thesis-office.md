# Thesis Office Concerns

Figure Captions: I believe not-full sentences are more common, but I can find no
specific regulations in the IEEE regs or Thesis Office regs, so consistency
should rule. Need to look up and make a good consistent decision all throughout
the dissertation. Maybe lean towards the non-sentence variety? Should find some
resources on this.


Figure Placement. FYI: They are absolute sticklers. Let me know if you have any
questions after you take a look at their rules. That one fig placement you
mention seemed to be the only problem. The solution is to place the first figure
on that page in question at the top of the page following the first mention--and
then do the same for the other fig.

For tables, no,  you do not want to stop the text before the table. Fill the
page with the table mention with text; in other words, do not stop the text.
Then place the table title on a page alone, followed by the table.


Be sure to include appendices, labeled A, B, C, etc.


Figure text must be at least 2mm. What about ones that this is impossible? I
have no source text to edit easily...


When referring to figure sub-parts, use Fig 2.1a, Fig. 2.1a) or Fig. 2.1(a),
what would Chris recommend? Papers have done it differently, and I can clean up
each to be the same.


See "ThesisOffice" mentions for additional, material-specific concerns.
