# Thesis Office Concerns

Figure Placement. FYI: They are absolute sticklers. Let me know if you have any
questions after you take a look at their rules. That one fig placement you
mention seemed to be the only problem. The solution is to place the first figure
on that page in question at the top of the page following the first mention--and
then do the same for the other fig. Examples to watch out for: #fig:framework, #fig:interaction, #fig:worksheet-example, #fig:sus, #fig:design-space

For tables, no, you do not want to stop the text before the table. Fill the
page with the table mention with text; in other words, do not stop the text.
Then place the table title on a page alone, followed by the table.


Be sure to include appendices, labeled A, B, C, etc.


Figure text must be at least 2mm.


Check Margins: 1.25 inches on the left and right and 1 inch only on the bottom


See "ThesisOffice" mentions for additional, material-specific concerns.
