# Thesis Office Concerns

Figure Placement. FYI: They are absolute sticklers. Let me know if you have any
questions after you take a look at their rules. That one fig placement you
mention seemed to be the only problem. The solution is to place the first figure
on that page in question at the top of the page following the first mention--and
then do the same for the other fig. Examples to watch out for: #fig:framework, #fig:interaction, #fig:worksheet-example, #fig:sus, #fig:design-space

See "ThesisOffice" mentions for additional, material-specific concerns.
