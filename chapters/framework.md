# Design Activity Framework

**_TODO:_**

  - copy in sections from daf or methods paper
  - get high level overview here, 3-4 pages
  - repeat that this is about bringing what is missing together
  - emphasize that this has happened piecemeal over many projects


The design process consists of the steps taken to achieve a given outcome, such as a visualization system.
Design decisions are the reasons and justification behind a choice made for a visualization, such as choosing a pie or bar chart.
The ultimate outcomes of any step of the design process and from design decisions are design artifacts, such as a system prototype.
No such work previously exists which connects all three of these aspects for visualization design.
