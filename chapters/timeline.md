# Timeline of Proposed Work

**_TODO:_**

  - add legends to both timeline figures!

Please see [@fig:timeline-prior] for an overview of work that has already been completed.
For this timeline, each of the rows corresponds to a different project and paper.

    - presented at IEEE VIS - InfoVis 2014
  - **P3:** Unlocked User-Centered Design Methods for Building Cyber Security Visualizations [@McKenna2015]
    - published through *Proceedings of IEEE Visualization for Cyber Security*
    - presented at IEEE VIS - VizSec 2015
  - **P4:** BubbleNet: A Cyber Security Dashboard for Visualizing Patterns [@mckenna2016]
    - published through *Computer Graphics Forum*
    - presenting at Eurovis 2016
  - **P5:** Animated Transitions and Techniques for Data Storytelling [@mckenna2017]
    - work in progress, see below for more details

The work remaining is outlined in [@fig:timeline-left].
The first set of items to be completed relate to **P5**, a data visualization storytelling authoring tool.
We plan to submit this work to CHI in September of 2016.
Part of this development process involves ideation among a design team, prototyping, and end user evaluation of the system and techniques we implement.

  Timeline of the work remaining to finish the dissertation, mostly with respect to **P5** and writing the dissertation (pink).

After writing this paper, we plan to reflect on this design process with respect to the design activity framework.
The rest of the steps relate to the dissertation.
Further background research will be conducted on the design activity framework, specifically with respect to agile development, a common question we have received with respect to the framework from various presentations at conferences.
By the end of December, we plan to complete any revisions to the design activity framework, as well as finish framing the introduction and background chapters.
By February, we plan to finish the final chapters, explaining the details of the formulation of the framework with the two case studies in cyber security and data storytelling for validation.
Then, we will finish up the final draft by March with the discussion, conclusion, future work, and final changes necessary for the dissertation.
Lastly, we will summarize this work into a dissertation defense, to be defended before the end of the Spring 2017 semester.
