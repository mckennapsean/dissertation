# Timeline

Most of the work has already been completed.
The design activity framework has already been formulated [@McKenna2014] and revised.
This work started several case studies in cyber security [@McKenna2015; @mckenna2016].
The case study in biology has also been completed [@mckenna2015s], but more thought will be spent reflecting on this project with respect to the design activity framework.
Lastly, the case study for data storytelling is ongoing, expected to be completed by this fall.


**_TODO:_**

  - _add description of two timelines_
  - _timeline of prior work (papers, submitted)_
  - _timeline of work left to do (project, dissertation, expected chapters, defense etc.)_
