# Case Study: Data Storytelling Authoring Tool {#sec:story}

For this investigation, we have begun to analyze various techniques used by authors on the web to convey data in a storytelling fashion using visualization.
From these techniques we observe, we will design a novel data storytelling authoring tool according to strategies we have seen.
For example, one such technique is the varying use of either scrolling or stepping for navigating a story with animated transitions.
We will employ several quantitative studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the storytelling techniques and the feasibility of this authoring tool to support them.
Finally, we plan to release the contents of this authoring tool for others to utilize these data storytelling techniques in their own work.
By reflecting on our design process of this authoring tool, this project will highlight the flexibility of the design activity framework by capturing and describing a project with more rigorous quantitative user evaluation of various visualization and interaction techniques.


Traditionally, stories in any medium are broken down into different states: from chapters in a book to scenes in a movie.
When consuming digital media on the web, readers have control of how they navigate through visual stories.
Two common practices for navigating these stories are first an arrow-button or stepper mechanic, clicking through multiple states one at a time,
and the second practice is to scroll down the page, revealing further states as they move onto the page.
In practice, visual storytelling seems to have utilized both of these mechanics, from traditional scrolling webpages to stepping through annotations on a chart to an interactively scrollable visual story.
With a pilot study, we found that users are split on favoring the scroller or stepper navigation mechanics.
This identified key features that are best in both: steppers are simple for a mouse or keyboard, require less interaction, and sync better with the text, while scrollers are more novel, provide a finer level of control, and work better for trackpads or touchscreens with inertial scrolling.


As a result of this pilot study, we will create a storytelling authoring tool, Steller, that combines both steppers and scrollers into a novel navigational paradigm for readers to navigate a visual story.
We have also found a distinction between various visual story components and the dimensions of a visual storytelling/reading experience, so this authoring tool will focus on the novelty of these dimensions over the components which have been explored in previous work [@Satyanarayan2014].
We will evaluate output of this authoring tool by performing a user study on how effective this authoring tool is for users to create their own visual stories.
We hope to find that our authoring tool is usable and meets this purpose
and that novel navigational mechanics will improve upon both the stepper and scroller design, to carve a path for more effective way for visual storytelling.

\al{seems distant from the rest. how to tie in?}
\sm{what about talking about evaluation and its ties to the design process? motivation for future design studies by formative work like this?}
