# Work I will do

[ + address Alex's high-level comments]

scope the dissertation to the target audience: novice visualization designers

- edit introduction and scope all chapters with this in mind



focus the design activity framework as being specific to visualization

- emphasize several key visualization-theory components, like the nested model and extension of the 9-stage framework for design studies
- clarify this focus in the introduction and throughout the dissertation, especially the case studies



more complete comparison to existing work, including what existing work is missing

- detailed comparison with what the 9-stage framework is missing
- a few more resources to include, as recommended by committee members
- clearer use and distinction of the terms “creative”/“creativity”
- add a short section on agile software development and design, and how this relates to the framework



add in more components of the design activity framework, and why they address what is missing from existing work

- discussion of the timelines for the design activity framework and how they are used
- table of various design methods and how to use this table in the design process



integrate a rich discussion of the design activity framework as part of the work completed (case studies)

- for formative projects, add descriptions of what was missing in existing design models that held back these projects
- for bubble-net design study, clearly walk through the project within the framework and reflect on its use



conduct external validation of the framework with appropriate users (novice vis designers)

- possibly work with students from a visualization course, if they have a design project, to teach and monitor their use of the framework
- otherwise, could run a special workshop with the framework, perhaps targeted around a data visualization contest



I'd really like to see the worksheets etc. - this could also be helpful when you want to do the validation.





## Work I would like to do (given time

simplify core components of the design activity framework into a textbook-like overview, with a more cohesive main figure that describes the macro and micro components altogether

prepare worksheets and other materials/tools available online for others to more easily utilize and take action using the framework
