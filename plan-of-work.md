# Work I will do

1. scope the dissertation to the target audience: novice visualization designers


2. focus the design activity framework as being specific to visualization

- emphasize several key visualization-theory components, like the nested model and extension of the 9-stage framework for design studies
- clarify this focus in the introduction and throughout the dissertation, especially the case studies: what does this framework provide over previous work?


3. more complete comparison to existing work, including what existing work is missing

- detailed comparison with what the 9-stage framework is missing
- include this overview in daf chapter


4. add in more components of the design activity framework, and why they address what is missing from existing work


5. integrate a rich discussion of the design activity framework as part of the work completed (case studies)

- for formative projects, add descriptions of what was missing in existing design models that held back these projects
- for bubble-net design study, clearly walk through the project within the framework and reflect on its use


If time:

- simplify core components of the design activity framework into a textbook-like overview, with a more cohesive main figure that describes the macro and micro components altogether
