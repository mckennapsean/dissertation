# Work I will do

1. scope the dissertation to the target audience: novice visualization designers


2. focus the design activity framework as being specific to visualization


3. more complete comparison to existing work, including what existing work is missing


4. add in more components of the design activity framework, and why they address what is missing from existing work


5. integrate a rich discussion of the design activity framework as part of the work completed (case studies)



If time:

- simplify core components of the design activity framework into a textbook-like overview, with a more cohesive main figure that describes the macro and micro components altogether
- web accessible components
