This directory contains a minimal sample University of Utah thesis
without color, and without indexing.  You are encouraged to
investigate sample-thesis-1 and sample-thesis-2 for examples of how to
exploit those additional features.

The easiest way to compile the minimal sample thesis on any Unix
platform is to simply type

	make

That runs the rough equivalent of these commands

	pdflatex sample-thesis-0.ltx
	bibtex sample-thesis-0

repeated FOUR (4) times to achieve consistency.

During the writing process, the fastest update is done by

	make pdf-pass

It runs pdflatex and bibtex just once.  If the bibliography is already
stable, then only pdflatex needs to be run:

	pdflatex sample-thesis-0.ltx
