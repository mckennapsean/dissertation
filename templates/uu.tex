%%% The student-specific front matter fields are defined here:
\author                 {$author$}
\title                  {$title$}
\thesistype             {dissertation}

\dedication             {To ...}

%%% Most students need just a short degree name, like this:
% \degree                 {Doctor of Philosophy}
%%% However, multiline degrees are possible, and are done like this:
\degree                 {$degree$}

%%% College- and Department-level definitions:
\approvaldepartment     {Computing}
\department             {$department$}
\graduatedean           {$graduateDean$}
\departmentchair        {$departmentChair$}

%%% The graduate student's committee members:
\committeechair         {$committeeChair$}
\firstreader            {$committeeMember1$}
\secondreader           {$committeeMember2$}
\thirdreader            {$committeeMember3$}
\fourthreader           {$committeeMember4$}
\chairtitle             {$committeeChairTitle$}


%%% NB: It is rare, but possible, for there to be two chairs, For
%%% example, one student had
%%%
%%% \committeechair{\mbox{\small Andrej Cherkaev and Andrejs Treibergs}}
%%%
%%% The \mbox{} ensures that line breaks cannot happen, and the \small
%%% is necessary to make the names fit on the Dissertation Approval form

%%% Dates that must be adjusted for each academic term, and be permitted
%%% according to the University of Utah Thesis Office:
\submitdate             {$submitDate$}
\copyrightyear          {$copyrightYear$}

%%% Dates on which committee members approved the thesis
\chairdateapproved      {$committeeApproved$}
