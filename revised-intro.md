# Introduction

What about.
Why should we care?
What motivated this work?
Type of work, tech. vs appl., what our focus is.
5 goals:
- artifacts, recordability, documentable, transferable?, **achievable**
- flexibility, recordable, **flexible**
- decision-?, evaluatability, guidelines?, guidable?, **justifiable**
- UCD methods, usability? needs, involvement, visibility/accessibility/legibility/language, **discoverable**
- actionability, tangible?, **actionable**
Summarize all of your work in one sentence here.

(+ ?) --- dive into the above pieces, logically and with clear bullet points per paragraph

Achievable: Process models should highlight the desired outcomes such that the steps are clear in both where you are and what you should accomplish by the end of that step.

Flexible: Process models should support aspects of a creative process that encompass concepts like complex iteration, divergent concept exploration, and promoting unique improvements or changes over existing artifacts. (TODO check into the creative process model definition?)

Justifiable: A process model incorporates design methods during each step, and these steps can involve evaluation that result in validation, justification, and formation of guidelines, as well as existing guidelines, that inform the design process. It is important to capture these decisions and rationale for establishing rigor and transferability in the process.

Discoverable: Process models incorporate design methods for generating and evaluating visualization artifacts, and these methods be established in a variety of fields. User-centered design includes many methods that focus on establishing and designing for the needs of the user, which can be critical in applied-driven research with domain experts, so it is important for a model to highlight, correlate, and promote the discovery and inclusion of new kinds of user-centered design methods.

Actionable: An important aspect to a design model is how well it is understood, taught, and utilized by visualization designers, and the challenges faced by teaching a complex, iterative process to novices provide an opportunity for crafting materials and finding novel ways to make a design model more approachable with succinct terminology and concrete steps for novices to walk through their own design process.
